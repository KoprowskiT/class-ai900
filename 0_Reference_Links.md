## Responsible AI use 

To support Microsoft's [Responsible AI Standard](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/21/microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly/), a new [Limited Access policy](https://aka.ms/AAh91ff) has been implemented for the Face service and Computer Vision service.

Anyone can use the Face service to:
* Detect the location of faces in an image
* Determine if a face is wearing glasses
* Determine if there's occlusion, blur, noise, or over/under exposure for any of the faces
* Return the head pose coordinates for each face in an image

The Limited Access policy requires customers to [submit an intake form](https://aka.ms/facerecognition) to access additional Face service capabilities, including:
* The ability to compare faces for similarity Â 
* The ability to identify named individuals in an image

The Microsoft guidance for responsible generative AI is designed to be practical and actionable. It defines a four-stage process to develop and implement a plan for responsible AI when using generative models. The four stages in the process are:

Identify potential harms that are relevant to your planned solution.
Measure the presence of these harms in the outputs generated by your solution.
Mitigate the harms at multiple layers in your solution to minimize their presence and impact and ensure transparent communication about potential risks to users.
Operate the solution responsibly by defining and following a deployment and operational readiness plan.

These stages correspond closely to the NIST AI Risk Management Framework functions - check it out [here](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)
